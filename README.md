This is **layout of website**. Here I used only  **HTML and CSS**, **flexbox**. 
**The goal of the project was to work with different tools**, so I used such libraries and plugins:
- icomoon for certain icons (don't include the whole library awesome). 
- normalize.css for cross-browser (except IE)
- jquery library
- Slick-Slider
- fancybox.min.css for modal windows

The project is **validated** without  errors and warnings, all **images are optimized**  and the site  is **adaptive**  for mobile phone, tablet and desktop.
